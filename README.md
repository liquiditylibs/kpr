# KRP - Krzysztof Request Provider Library

## Overview

KRP - Krzysztof Request Provider is designed for seamless integration with WalletConnect's Web3Inbox and Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This library enables applications to send notifications to Ethereum addresses and ENS names and to facilitate and handle cross-chain transactions. Leveraging Web3.js for Ethereum blockchain interactions, including ENS name resolution, KRP provides a user-friendly approach to managing cross-chain communications.

## Features

Send notifications via WalletConnect's Web3Inbox.
Handle cross-chain transactions using Chainlink's CCIP.
Resolve Ethereum Name Service (ENS) addresses.
Easy integration with Ethereum and other blockchain-based applications.
Installation

## To use the KRP library in your project, follow these steps:

Install Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.

Install the Library: Clone this repository or install the library via NPM (if published):

```
npm install krp-library
```

or

```
yarn add krp-library
```

### Install Web3.js: The library requires Web3.js for ENS resolution:

```
npm install web3
```

or

```
yarn add web3
```

## Usage

Initialization

First, initialize the KRP library with your project ID, API secret from WalletConnect, and an Ethereum RPC URL:

```
const KRP = require('krp-library');
const rpcUrl = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID';

const service = new KRP('your_project_id', 'your_api_secret', rpcUrl);
```

## Sending Notifications

To send a notification:

```
service.sendNotification(
  'notification_type_id',
  'Your Notification Title',
  'Your notification body',
  ['vitalik.eth', '0x123...']
).then(response => {
  console.log('Notification sent:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

## Handling Cross-Chain Transactions

KRP can be extended to handle incoming cross-chain transactions through Chainlink's CCIP, allowing your application to respond to events occurring on different blockchains.

## Use Cases

Cross-Chain Interactions: Facilitate and monitor cross-chain transactions in your decentralized applications (dApps), enhancing the user experience.

DeFi Platforms: Integrate cross-chain functionalities for diverse financial operations like swapping assets, providing liquidity, or managing cross-chain collateral.

NFT Marketplaces and Governance: Extend your reach across multiple blockchains, allowing for a more inclusive and broadened user base.

Real-Time Notifications: Keep users informed with real-time updates about cross-chain transaction statuses, confirmations, and potential actions required.
